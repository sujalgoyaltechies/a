</h2>
<p>Our laptops have gone through a multi-step refurbishment process. When we source a new device, it is booted into our testing software, which retrieves the device's vital information, such as hard drive, RAM, screen, and battery details. This step ensures that the specifications on our refurbished laptops for sale are correct.</p>
<p>The used laptop is then functionally tested, which includes checking the hard drive, functionality and defects of the screen, the keyboard, ports, battery life, and so on. If any issues are reported will be addressed in the following process.</p>
<p>Our refurbishing process finishes with resolving any issues found during the audit. Our final step includes installing a new operating system, final functionality testing and cleaning.</p>
